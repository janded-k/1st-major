                The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has gone to Owerri to commission a house and also attend a 
                meeting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Obi who spoke in Owerri, Imo State on Saturday while inaugurating the new Secretariat of the party donated by one of his supporters, said that Nigeria cannot continue the way it is.
            </p>

            <p>
                He said, “As you know, campaigns have not started. So, I am not here for campaigns. I am here to receive from a wonderful supporter, who gave us this building to support our Labour movement.
            </p>

            <p>
                We have not started campaigns. When campaigns start, we will come and we will be able to tell you what we are going to do. But one thing we will assure you is that our journey is not a normal campaign. We are bringing back Nigerians, to take back Nigeria.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are going to take back Nigeria and give it to the youth where it belongs. When that time comes, you will know. We will be able to change this country. It cannot continue the way it is, today

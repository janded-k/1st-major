            The director-general of the Tinubu Support Organisation (TSO), Aminu Suleiman, has signed a N100 million cheque for former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, to purchase the presidential 
            nomination form of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as this makes Tinubu the first person to purchase the party presidential ticket.
            The nomination form will sell for N70 million while expression of interest forms will go for N30 million.

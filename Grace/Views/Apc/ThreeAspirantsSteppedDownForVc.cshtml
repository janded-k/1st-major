            Senator kabiru Gaya, the director general of the Yemi Osinbajo Campaign Organisation,
            said  that three Presidential aspirants had stepped down for the Vice-President.

However, the senator failed to identify the three aspirants, only claiming that former Senate President Ken Nnamani who stepped down on Monday did so in honour of Osinbajo.

            He, however, said the aspirants are expected to officially announce their withdrawal from the race before the commencement of voting.
            Whatever the number the party decides, the people need to come and address the party members and tell them if they are stepping down, why are they stepping down, and for who.
